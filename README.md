# hybrid-approach-for-stock-prediction
This project demonstrates a Hybrid LSTM + Quantum Neural Network (QNN) model built using TensorFlow and PennyLane to predict NIFTY Bank Index stock prices.The model combines the temporal learning power of LSTM with the non-linear feature transformation capabilities of quantum circuits,providing a modern approach to financial time-series forecasting
